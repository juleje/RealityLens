# RealityLens - Augmented Reality Exploration
RealityLens is a mobile web application that enhances real-world exploration through Augmented Reality (AR). Developed as part of The Lab course at KdG, the project was conceptualized by BPart to provide users with real-time information about their surroundings by navigating a digital map and unlocking AR experiences at specific locations.

## Technology Stack
- Backend: Java Spring Boot
- Frontend: Thymeleaf (server-side rendering)
- AR Integration: AR.js & A-Frame
- Hosting: Netlify

## Concept & Development
Initially, RealityLens was built using marker-based and image-based AR approaches. However, after further iteration, we opted for a location-based AR system, which allows users to explore real-world points of interest without the need for physical markers. As users walk around, their avatar moves on the map, and upon reaching designated locations, they can use their camera to reveal AR-generated insights about construction projects, historical landmarks, or urban developments.

By combining interactive mapping with real-time AR overlays, RealityLens provides an engaging and educational way to interact with the evolving world around us.
