# RealityLens - Augmented Reality Exploration
RealityLens is a mobile web application that enhances real-world exploration through Augmented Reality (AR). Developed as part of The Lab course at KdG, the project was conceptualized by BPart to provide users with real-time information about their surroundings by navigating a digital map and unlocking AR experiences at specific locations.
